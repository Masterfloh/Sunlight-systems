# Contributing

Below are some general rules & guidelines to keep in mind before and while contributing : 

1. Is your Contribution fit for Disitribution? Is there Data leaking anywhere or is there perhaps a Security Issue? 
2. Are the steps one can take to make the feature more redundant? Redundancy is key when making python scripts! I.e use functions instead of loops when possible
3. Is your Contribution relevant? Does it increase the overall functionality of the bot?
4. Make sure you remove your Bot Token before making the Pull request!
